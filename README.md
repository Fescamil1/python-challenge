Using Python concepts to complete two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

### **PyBanK**

Uses a Python script to analyze the financial records for a company. It uses the financial data stored in a file called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Finally, the script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file. 

### PyPoll

The script concept is vote counting process. The script uses a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.  

Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

At the end, the script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file.
